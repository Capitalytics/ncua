# Ncua

The NCUA [lets you search for a credit union office](http://www.ncua.gov/NCUAMapping/Pages/NCUAGOVMapping.aspx) by name, address and charter number. Their site uses a JSON api behind their

This gem is a ruby client to that API. It's totally unaffiliated with the NCUA.
It's open source, so anyone can use it, and anyone can help maintain it. At
this point, it's maintained by [the
developers](http://engineering.continuity.net/) at

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
  gem 'ncua'
```

And then execute:
```
  $ bundle
```
Or install it yourself as:
```
  $ gem install ncua
```
## Usage

Currently all of our features are namespaced under the `NCUA` module.

The NCUA lets you find a Credit Union office by its name, charter number, or within an address:

```ruby
  credit_unions = NCUA.find_by_name('Federal')  #=> [NCUA::CreditUnion, ... ]
```

You can `find_by` `name`, `address`, `charter_number`. Searching by address takes an optional radius argument to limit the scope of the address query (units are in miles):
```ruby
  credit_unions = NCUA.find_by_charter_number(12345)  #=> [NCUA::CreditUnion, ... ]

  credit_unions = NCUA.find_by_address("125 Main St., Anywhere, CT", radius: 50)  #=> [NCUA::CreditUnion, ... ]
  
```

Right now, an `NCUA::CreditUnion` has all of the following getters:
